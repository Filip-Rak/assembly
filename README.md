# Overview
This repository contains various assembly code samples that I developed during my 'Computer Architectures' class at AGH University of Krakow, in the second semester.

# Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **exercises**: Contains exercises completed during classes.
- **notes**: Includes my personal notes on assembly for studying and exams.
- **practice-scripts**: Scripts created for personal practice and experimentation.
- **tests**: Holds the tests conducted during the course period.
